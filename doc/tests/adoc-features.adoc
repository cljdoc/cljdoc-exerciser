== Introduction
A test AsciiDoctor doc to exercise cljdoc formatting and features.

This document exists to compare basic features with CommonMark. If you edit this
doc please also edit its link:md-features.md[CommonMark counterpart].

AsciiDoctor offers a very rich set of formatting options, see the
link:asciidoctor-user-manual.adoc[AsciiDoctor User Manual] for all the details.

== Formatting marks

I have a *strong* feeling that I might be head**strong**.

If I use _italics_ does that make things more g__lean__able?

Does this [.line-through]#strike# you as a [.line-through]##cross##word?

My `code` was en``coded``ed.

I am ^super^ excited about this ~sub~routine.

== Code blocks
Here we have some clojure code :

[source,clojure]
----
;; some sweet clojure code

(defn hello-earthling
  "Greet an earthling in a believable way."
  [name]
  (println "Hello earthling " (uppercase name)))
----

If we specify `clojure-repl` to asciidoctor as our language, we can invoke special highlighting for a repl session:

[source,clojure-repl]
----
user=> (require '[clojure.string :as string])
nil
user=> (string/reverse "step on no pets")
"step on no pets"
user=> (reduce + 0 [1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 6])
42
user=>
----

Asciidoctor also supports callouts and titles:

.code-block-title
[source,clojure]
----
;; some sweet clojure code

(defn hello-earthling
  "Greet an earthling in a believable way."  ;; <1>
  [name]
  (println "Hello earthling " (uppercase name))) ;; <2>
----
<1> a docstring comes before the arguments
<2> check with an earthling if uppercasing is soothing

== Lists

Bulleted:

* apples
* orange
** temple
** navel
* bananas

Numbered:

. first
.. a
.. b
... x
... y
. second
. third

Mixed:

* Hey
.. one
.. two
* Ho
** Ho
... uno
... dos

With code:

. one
.. two
+
----
I am a code block
----

.. three

== Images
This local image should work on github and cljdoc.  According to asciidoctor, images are resolved relative to the document or at the path specified by the `imagesdir` asciidoctor attribute.

Current value of `imagesdir`:

[subs=attributes+]
----
{imagesdir}
----

image:test-image-1.png[A local test image should appear here]

Here's a remote image:

image:https://picsum.photos/id/1041/400/100[A remote test image should appear here]

How about captions, do we display those nicely?

== Links

Local link: link:md-features.md[cljdoc markdown features]

External link: https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-vs-markdown[AsciiDoc vs Markdown]

Link to anchor: <<anchorid>>


As far as I can figure, Asciidoctor does not support root relative http links - so we need to fully qualify links to our APIs:

1. https://cljdoc.org/d/lread/cljdoc-exerciser/CURRENT/api/cljdoc-exerciser.core#exercise3[A link to cljdoc-exerciser.core/excercise3]
2. https://cljdoc.org/d/lread/cljdoc-exerciser/CURRENT/api/cljdoc-exerciser.core[A link to cljdoc-exerciser.core]

If they are not already, these will soon be converted to root relative links by cljdoc to support local testing.

== Tables

Asciidoc tables are quite full featured.

Here is the most basic example:

|===
| Heading 1 | Heading 2

| col1, row1
| col2, row1

| col1, row2
| col2, row2

| col1, row3
| col2, row3

| col1, row4
| col2, row4
|===

Sophisticated alignment support is also available, here is a basic example:

[cols=">,^,<"]
|===
| Right aligned col | Centered col | Left aligned Col

| am
| is
| any

| I
| this
| thing

| right?
| centered?
| left?
|===

Here's the same table with a title

.This time with a title
|===
| Heading 1 | Heading 2

| col1, row1
| col2, row1

| col1, row2
| col2, row2
|===

And here's a nested table example from asciidoctor user manual:

[cols="1,2a"]
|===
| Col 1 | Col 2

| Cell 1.1
| Cell 1.2

| Cell 2.1
| Cell 2.2

[cols="2,1"]
!===
! Col1 ! Col2

! C11
! C12

!===

|===

Here's a table with custom sizing:

[cols="10,40,20,~",options="header"]
|====
|10% width
|40% width
|20% width
|remaining

|a
|b
|c
|d

|e
|f
|g
|h

|i
|j
|k
|l

|m
|n
|o
|p
|====

An autowidth table will only be as wide as it needs to be.footnote:[file,grabbed from asciidoctor user manual]

[%autowidth]
|===
|Name of Column 1 |Name of Column 2 |Name of Column 3

|Cell in column 1, row 1
|Cell in column 2, row 1
|Cell in column 3, row 1

|Cell in column 1, row 2
|Cell in column 2, row 2
|Cell in column 3, row 2
|===

== Emojis

Asciidoctor does not support codes like GitHub flavored markdown does, but it does have support for icons when font-awesome is enabled.

icon:heart[] icon:heart[size=2x]


[#anchorid]
== Anchored heading
And here we are.

== Admonitions
From most serious to least:

IMPORTANT: Important things are said here.

WARNING: Warning to the wise.

CAUTION: Aren't you a caution?

NOTE: Note that this note is a note.

TIP: Tip the scales with a tip.

And how do admonitions look with some code in them?

== Drawings

Do we support svgbob? Not yet but if we someday decide to, this sample from the svgbob demo site won't look like ASCII art.

[svgbob]
....
              .─.
             ( 0 )
              `-'
            /     \
           /       \
          V         V
         .─.         .─.
        ( 1 )       ( 4 )
         `-'         `-' .
       /   \         |  \ `.
      /     \        |   \  `.
     V       V       |    \   `.

                     `─'   `─'   `─'
....

== Embedded html

Although it is discouraged, AsciiDoctor does support passthroughs.

AsciiDoctor renders pass:[<b>passed through</b>] embedded html.
