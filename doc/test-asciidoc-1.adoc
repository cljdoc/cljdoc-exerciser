== Introduction
A test asciidoc to exercise cljdoc formatting and features.

== Formatting marks

I have a *strong* feeling that I might be head**strong**.

I am _under_ the impression that that you are th__under__struck by this example.

My `code` was en``coded``ed.

I am ^super^ excited about this ~sub~routine.

== Code blocks

.code-block-title
[source,clojure]
----
;; some sweet clojure code

(defn hello-earthling
  "Greet an earthling in a believable way."  ;; <1>
  [name]
  (println "Hello earthling " (uppercase name))) ;; <2>
----
<1> a docstring comes before the arguments
<2> check with an earthling if uppercasing is soothing

== Images
This local image should work on github and cljdoc.  According to asciidoctor, images are resolved relative to the document.

Current value of imagesdir:

[subs=attributes+]
----
{imagesdir}
----

image:test-image-1.png[A local test image should appear here]

How about captions, do we display those nicely?

== Admonitions

NOTE: Note that this note is a note.

TIP: Tip the scales with a tip.

IMPORTANT: Important things are said here.

CAUTION: Aren't you a caution?

WARNING: Warning to the wise.

== Tables

Asciidoc tables are quite full featured, here's a simple one:

|===
| Heading 1 | Heading 2

| col1, row1
| col2, row1

| col1, row2
| col2, row2

| col1, row3
| col2, row3

| col1, row4
| col2, row4
|===

Here's the same table with a title

.This time with a title
|===
| Heading 1 | Heading 2

| col1, row1
| col2, row1

| col1, row2
| col2, row2
|===

And here's a nested table example from asciidoctor user manual:

[cols="1,2a"]
|===
| Col 1 | Col 2

| Cell 1.1
| Cell 1.2

| Cell 2.1
| Cell 2.2

[cols="2,1"]
!===
! Col1 ! Col2

! C11
! C12

!===
