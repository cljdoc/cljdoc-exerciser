= Test Asciidoc 1
:toc:
:figure-caption!:

== Introduction
A test asciidoc to exercise cljdoc formatting and features.

== Formatting marks

I have a *strong* feeling that I might be head**strong**.

I am _under_ the impression that that you are th__under__struck by this example.

My `code` was en``coded``ed.

I am ^super^ excited about this ~sub~routine.

== Code blocks
Here we have some clojure code:
.code-block-title
[source,clojure]
----
;; some sweet clojure code

(defn hello-earthling
  "Greet an earthling in a believable way."  ;; <1>
  [name]
  (println "Hello earthling " (uppercase name))) ;; <2>
----
<1> a docstring comes before the arguments
<2> check with an earthling if uppercasing is soothing

I we specify `clojure-repl` as our language, we can even highlight a repl session:
[source,clojure-repl]
----
user=> (require '[clojure.string :as string])
nil
user=> (string/reverse "step on no pets")
"step on no pets"
user=> (reduce + 0 [1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 6])
42
user=>
----

== Images
This local image should work on github and cljdoc.  According to asciidoctor, images are resolved relative to the document.

Current value of imagesdir:

[subs=attributes+]
----
{imagesdir}
----

image:test-image-1.png[A local test image should appear here]

How about captions, do we display those nicely?

.Test image caption
image:test-image-1.png[A local test image should appear here]


== Admonitions
From most serious to least:

IMPORTANT: Important things are said here.

WARNING: Warning to the wise.

CAUTION: Aren't you a caution?

NOTE: Note that this note is a note.

TIP: Tip the scales with a tip.

And how do admonitions look with some code in them?

[IMPORTANT]
====
This admonition has some `code` in it.

== Tables

Asciidoc tables are quite full featured, here's a simple one:

|===
| Heading 1 | Heading 2

| col1, row1
| col2, row1

| col1, row2
| col2, row2

| col1, row3
| col2, row3

| col1, row4
| col2, row4
|===

Here's the same table with a title

.This time with a title
|===
| Heading 1 | Heading 2

| col1, row1
| col2, row1

| col1, row2
| col2, row2
|===

And here's a nested table example from asciidoctor user manual:

[cols="1,2a"]
|===
| Col 1 | Col 2

| Cell 1.1
| Cell 1.2

| Cell 2.1
| Cell 2.2

[cols="2,1"]
!===
! Col1 ! Col2

! C11
! C12

!===

|===

Here's a table with custom sizing:

[cols="10,40,20,~",options="header"]
|====
|10% width
|40% width
|20% width
|remaining

|a
|b
|c
|d

|e
|f
|g
|h

|i
|j
|k
|l

|m
|n
|o
|p
|====

An autowidth table will only be as wide as it needs to be.footnote:[file,grabbed from asciidoctor user manual]

[%autowidth]
|===
|Name of Column 1 |Name of Column 2 |Name of Column 3

|Cell in column 1, row 1
|Cell in column 2, row 1
|Cell in column 3, row 1

|Cell in column 1, row 2
|Cell in column 2, row 2
|Cell in column 3, row 2
|===

== Drawings

Do we support svgbob? If so, this sample from the svgbob demo site won't look like ASCII art.

[svgbob]
....
              .─.
             ( 0 )
              `-'
            /     \
           /       \
          V         V
         .─.         .─.
        ( 1 )       ( 4 )
         `-'         `-' .
       /   \         |  \ `.
      /     \        |   \  `.
     V       V       |    \   `.
    .─.      .─.     V     V    V
   ( 2 )    ( 3 )    .─.   .─.   .─.
    `─'      `─'    ( 5 ) ( 6 ) ( 7 )
                     `─'   `─'   `─'
